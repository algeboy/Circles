# Circles

Circles are a practice illustration of using equality as a means to improve programs.

The context is intentionally very simple.  Start with a concept that as multiple natural defining characteristics.  For example a circle is as much defined by its radius as it is by its diameter, circumference, or area.  Even in terms of information we would store each of these as a float-point number (a `float` or `double`in conventional typed programming language).  An algorithm that uses a circle might favor one description over another but this is subject to context.  On the scale of this simple task the work we want to avoid is constantly swapping interpretations.  Instead, we would like to develop a type `Circle` which can compile to the version used by individual tasks.
